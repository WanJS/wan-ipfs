# Simple Wanchain + InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)+ React.js DApp

A simple DApp to upload a document to IPFS and then store the IPFS hash on the Wanchain blockchain. Once the IPFS hash number is sent to the Wanchain blockchain, the user will receive a transaction receipt. We will use Create-React-App framework to make a front-end. This Dapp works with any user that has WanMask installed in their browser.

This repository was created originally for this great tutorial and has been adapted to work with Wanchain

## Installation

### Deploy contract
To recreate this site first create the contract (StoreHash.sol). You can use Remix(https://remix.ethereum.org) for that together with WanMask(https://wanmask.io/). Create a new file, paste the contents of the .sol file and deploy.

### Update files
Then update the contract address in storehash.js with your contract address (and ABI if you changed the contract). Then run the app with `npm start`

### Make production build
run `npm run build` to make a build in the build directory. You can then upload the complete dApp to IPFS to run it from the cload with `npm run upload`. You can find the url by looking at the last hash:
```
  ...
  { path: 'build',
    hash: 'QmXCSxk3ECr65ZGPYkHbn1ayREkjomGBhnJF4rAvDca9m4',
    size: 2426590 } ]

```
Your url would be: https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmXCSxk3ECr65ZGPYkHbn1ayREkjomGBhnJF4rAvDca9m4 but its available on all ipfs nodes (after a while):
http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmXCSxk3ECr65ZGPYkHbn1ayREkjomGBhnJF4rAvDca9m4/ or
http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXCSxk3ECr65ZGPYkHbn1ayREkjomGBhnJF4rAvDca9m4/ or


First time loading from IPFS takes a while and might require an F5 ;)
